# System-Stats-Plus

Miss programs only available on the Mac? So do we. Here's an extension
for GNOME that brings easy visualization of system resources such as:

- Per CPU core/processor utilization
- RAM utilization
- Swap memory utilization
- Network utilization

In addition to utilization displayed in the tray, it offers drop down
display of historical utilizations.

## Motivation:

This extension is based on a fork of the [Gnome-Stats-Pro](https://github.com/tpenguin/gnome-stats-pro) extension created by Joseph Benden (@tpenguin). Given that there have been no updates or bug fixes, with pending Pull Requests in his repository since GNOME version 3.38, I found myself quite fond of it on my desktop. Hence, I dedicated some time to port this extension to GNOME 45.
